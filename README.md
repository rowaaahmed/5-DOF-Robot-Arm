# Overview 

This project centers around the development of a 5-axis robotic arm that is both cost-effective and 
highly adaptable, leveraging modern open-source hardware and software platforms. The 
mechanical structure of the robot is entirely 3D printed, making it lightweight, affordable, and easy 
to replicate or modify. The use of 3D printing not only reduces production costs but also 
encourages rapid prototyping and customization, making this platform ideal for educational and 
research environments where flexibility and accessibility are essential.

One of the standout features of the project is its dual-mode control architecture. The robotic arm 
can be operated via the Robot Operating System “ROS”. ROS provides a robust framework for 
developers looking to implement advanced robotics algorithms and test real-world robotics 
applications in a simulated or physical environment. Alternatively, the system can be controlled 
through a custom-built MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI), which offers a more accessible 
and user-friendly approach. The MATLAB GUI allows users to manually control the robotic arm, 
execute predefined motion sequences, and visualize system behavior in real time, making it 
particularly useful in educational settings and during the early stages of development and testing.
